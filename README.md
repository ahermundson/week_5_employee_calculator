##Employee Data Collector

The purpose of this app is to collect an employee's name, ID number, job title and annual salary. Upon submit, the employee's information is appended to the table and the monthly salary expenditure is calculated. Employee's can be deleted from the table and their monthly expenditure will be removed from the total.
